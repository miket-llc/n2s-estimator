- Product role mapping for Banner/Colleague differences
- Comprehensive validation and error handling

**Quality Assurance**
- Complete test suite with deterministic number verification
- Configuration validation and methodology drift detection

- Pre-commit hooks for automated code quality
- 85%+ test coverage requirement

### Technical Implementation

**Architecture**
- Modular design with clear separation of concerns
- Pydantic data models with business rule validation
- Stateless calculation engines for reliability
- Caching for performance optimization

**Data Pipeline**
- 10-step deterministic calculation flow
- Input validation → Configuration loading → Base calculation
- Stage allocation → Presales split → Role expansion
- Delivery splits → Cost calculation → Add-on packages
- Results aggregation → Export generation

**Validation Framework**
- Input validation with user-friendly error messages
- Configuration validation with warnings for drift
- Runtime validation for business rule compliance
- Expected results verification in test suite

**Development Workflow**
- Make-based automation for all quality gates
- Automated formatting and linting
- Type checking with mypy
- Security scanning with bandit
- Complexity analysis with radon

### Expected Results (Default Scenario)

**Base N2S Package (Banner, Net New, Medium, US):**
- Total Hours: 6,700
- Presales Hours: 150.75 (Start: 100.5, Prepare: 50.25)
- Delivery Hours: 6,549.25

**Stage Breakdown:**
- Start: 167.5h, Prepare: 167.5h, Sprint 0: 402h
- Plan: 670h, Configure: 2,278h, Test: 1,340h
- Deploy: 670h, Go-Live: 402h, Post Go-Live: 603h

**Add-ons (with defaults):**
